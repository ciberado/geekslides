## Why?

**Geekslides** is a different way of managing presentations, designed to provide a better **remote** experience both for the assistants and the speakers. Many non-usual features are implemented, like:

* ![A group of nodes](images/nodes.png) Remotely controlling a **web based** slideshow
* ![A whiteboard](images/white-board.png) Painting tools and **whiteboard**  
(stylus compatible)
* ![Transformating shapes](images/transformation.png) Presentation, speaker and  
  **book modes**
* ![A line chart](images/graphs.png) Easy presentation of data as animated **charts**

> This page includes a nice markdown syntax trick: a line ended by two or more spaces will not 
> break the current element, but add a new line.

## Remote control

![A group of nodes](images/nodes.png)

**Synchronize** different browsers (in the same laptop or in the other corner of the world) without
needing to share your screen, allowing extra-smooth effects while **preserving bandwidth**.  
More importantly, you can keep using your **communication tool for camera sharing**, enhancing
both the student and the teacher experience.  
Also, several persons can control the flow of the show **at the same time**:
no more *next slide please*!
