## Presentation

**Geekslides** is a different way of managing presentations, designed to provide a better **remote** experience both for the assistants and the speakers. The main non-usual features includes:

* ![A group of nodes](images/nodes.png) Remotely controlling a **web based** slideshow
* ![A whiteboard](images/white-board.png) Painting tools and **whiteboard**  
(compatible with stylus)
* ![Transformating shapes](images/transformation.png) Presentation, speaker and **book modes**
* ![A line chart](images/graphs.png) Easy presentation of data as animated **charts**

> This page includes a nice markdown syntax trick: a line ended by two or more spaces will not 
> break the current element, but add a new line.
